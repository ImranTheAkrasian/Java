## Problem 1: When I configure logback.xml file to write the logs in a file using RollingFileAppender it was not working. It was shwoing this type of error 
```vbnet
|-ERROR in ch.qos.logback.core.pattern.parser.Compiler@... - Failed to instantiate converter class [ch.qos.logback.classic.pattern.LoggerConverter] as a composite converter for keyword [logger] ch.qos.logback.core.util.IncompatibleClassException
|-ERROR in ch.qos.logback.core.pattern.parser.Compiler@... - Failed to create converter for [%logger] keyword
```
